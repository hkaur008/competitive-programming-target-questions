typical illustration of a tree 
 
               rootptr        
               L | 6| R     // ROOT NODE : TOP NODE
               /       \
              /         \





Root: top node in a tree
Child:  nodes that are next to each other and connected downwards 
parent: converse notion of child
siblings: nodes of same parent
descendant 
ancestor 
leaf node: node with no children
internal node: node with least one child
external node:

Types of trees:
>Full binary tree : every node has 0 or 2 children
>complete binary tree:
>balanced binary tree:height is O(log n)
>perfect binary tree:

tree traversal techniques:
depth first traversal
LNR //INORDER 
NLR 
LRN
breadth first traversal
LEVEL ORDER traversal
